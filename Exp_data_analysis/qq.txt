Question 1
Which of these commands will let you observe the first 10 rows of your dataframe? Assume it is named "df".

1 / 1 point

1
df.head(10)

1
df.tail()

1
df.head()

1
df.tail(10)
Correct
Correct! Since the default parameter of df.head() outputs the first 5 rows, we must specify the parameter to be 10.

2.
Question 2

How would you describe the above plot of total price?

1 / 1 point

Continuous variable.

Correct
Correct! Since as total price can take any continuous value above 0.


Categorical variable.


Left-skewed.


RIght-skewed.

Correct
Correct!  Total price is right-skewed as the right tail is longer.

3.
Question 3

The above plot is a regression plot of gross income and customer rating. There is a linear positive trend i.e. the higher the rating, the higher the gross income.

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct!  The trend line is almost flat, indicating there is an absence of a linear trend.

4.
Question 4
What are potential way(s) of handling missing data?

1 / 1 point

Remove the rows associated with missing values

Correct
Correct! Although discouraged in most cases, sometimes, if adjustment or imputation of values (for the row) does not benefit the analysis or predictive model, the row can be removed.


Replace it with the mean of their respective columns.

Correct
Correct! Mean imputation is a popular technique.


Replace it with the mode of their respective columns.

Correct
Correct! Missing values in categorical columns are sometimes imputed with the mode of their respective columns.

5.
Question 5
sns.heatmap() can be used to visualize the directional magnitudes in a correlation matrix.

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct! As was shown in task 5, Seaborn's .heatmap can take in 'df.corr' as an input to plot a correlation matrix, where the color represents directional magnitude of correlation.
